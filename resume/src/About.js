            </Typography>

            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
              Born and raised in Bengaluru, India, I completed my schooling and
              earned a B.E. in Electronics & Communication before beginning my
              career at GlobalLogic India Private Limited as a Software
              Engineer. There I built customer-facing web experiences and
              micro-services, worked closely with Product and Engineering
              Managers, and led Agile ceremonies as a Scrum Master.
            </Typography>

            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
              Partnering daily with cross-functional leaders highlighted a gap
              in my management toolkit, so I pursued an M.E.M. at California State University. 
              The program blended analytics, finance, and leadership
              with deep tech, equipping me to translate between business and
              engineering with confidence.
            </Typography>

            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
              I'm now seeking Business Analyst or related roles where I can
              combine my software background, data-driven mindset, and newly
              honed management skills to drive product strategy and deliver
              user-centric solutions.
            </Typography>

            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
              Outside work, you‚Äôll find me capturing cityscapes through my
              camera lens, hiking nearby trails, or giving back via open-source
              communities‚Äîalways learning, always building.
